# MouseDebounce-AK
Using AutoKey for linux which is built off of and utilizes python, this is a quick script to help debounce mouse buttons.
Please note this is my first Autokey script any improvments are welcome.

Background:
I own alot of old computer mice with most having the common problem of being having their buttons bounce (that is to say a click once is registered multiple times when pressed once due to rapid disconnect/reconnect of the button switch).
Hardware wise cleaning or replacing your mouse can improve your experience, there are also hardware changes that can be done that usly involve adding of a small capactitor to help even out a voltage, but is outside this scope and my skill set.
AutoKey is what I use to help with this on linux on windows I use AutoHotKey.
